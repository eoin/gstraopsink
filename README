gst-plugin is a template for writing your own GStreamer plug-in.

The code is deliberately kept simple so that you quickly understand the basics
of how to set up autotools and your source tree.

This template demonstrates :
- what to do in autogen.sh
- how to setup configure.ac (your package name and version, GStreamer flags)
- how to setup your source dir 
- what to put in Makefile.am

More features might get added to this template later on.
